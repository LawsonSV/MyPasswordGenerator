In this assignment I had to get a password generator working. To start, I made a list of arrays, a list of confirms, a series of if statements combining arrays together depending on the answer to the confirms, a for loop randomizing the character that appear in the generated password, and lastly I added an if statement checking if the the chosen character length was from 8-128 characters long, and an alert telling the user that it must be if it wasn't.
